# Vite Configuration for Google Analytics

## ✅ Current Configuration (Working)

Your Google Analytics measurement ID is properly configured! Here's how it works:

### 1. Environment Variable Method (Primary)

```bash
# .env file
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-2815CD09B3
```

### 2. Vite Automatic Loading

Vite automatically loads environment variables that start with `VITE_` and makes them available via `import.meta.env`:

```typescript
// In src/utils/analytics.ts
const MEASUREMENT_ID = import.meta.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

### 3. Enhanced Vite Config (Optional)

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
  const env = loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), '')

  return {
    plugins: [react()],
    base: '/ilona-profile/',
    define: {
      __GA_MEASUREMENT_ID__: JSON.stringify(env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID),
    },
  }
})
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Development**: Analytics disabled (logs to console only)
2. **Production**: Analytics active with your measurement ID
3. **Environment Detection**: Uses `import.meta.env.MODE` (not `process.env.NODE_ENV`)

## 🔧 Key Files Updated

- ✅ `.env` - Contains your measurement ID
- ✅ `src/utils/analytics.ts` - Uses Vite environment variables correctly
- ✅ `src/vite-env.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for environment
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Enhanced configuration
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Initializes analytics on app start

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Ready to Deploy!**

- Analytics code: ✅ Implemented
- Measurement ID: ✅ Configured (G-2815CD09B3)
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Environment: ✅ Production-ready

## 📊 What Will Be Tracked

Once deployed, your analytics will track:

### 🎯 Recruitment-Specific Events:

- Traffic sources and referrers

## 🔍 Testing the Configuration

You can verify the setup works by:

1. **Build and Deploy:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console** (after deployment):

   - Visit your site: https://pecca.github.io/ilona-profile
   - Open Developer Tools → Console
   - Look for: "Google Analytics initialized with ID: G-2815CD09B3"

3. **Check Google Analytics:**
   - Go to https://analytics.google.com
   - Navigate to Realtime reports
   - Visit your site and see real-time data

## 🎉 Success!

Your measurement ID is properly configured in the Vite setup. The analytics will start collecting data once you deploy the built application!

**Next Step:** Run `npm run deploy` to go live with analytics tracking.
