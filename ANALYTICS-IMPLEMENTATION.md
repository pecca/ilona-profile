## ðŸ“ˆ Option 3: Simple Custom Analytics

If you want something even simpler, I can create a basic analytics system that:

- Sends data to a simple backend service

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Google Analytics)

1. **Create Google Analytics account:**

   - Go to https://analytics.google.com/
   - Create account â†’ Property â†’ Web stream
   - Copy your Measurement ID

2. **Update your website:**

   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOUR_ACTUAL_ID

   # Deploy
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **View data:**
   - Real-time visitors: Analytics â†’ Realtime
   - Detailed reports: Analytics â†’ Reports

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll See in Analytics

### Visitor Information:

- **Geographic location** - See if coaches from specific universities/countries visit
- **Device type** - Desktop vs mobile usage
- **Time spent** - How long coaches engage with your profile
- **Traffic sources** - How they found your site

### Engagement Metrics:

- **Most viewed sections** - Athletic, Academic, Media Gallery
- **Video play rates** - Which rowing videos get attention
- **Contact form interactions** - The most important metric!
- **Return visitors** - Coaches coming back for second looks

### Key Metrics for Recruitment:

- **Time on Athletic section** - Shows serious interest in your rowing
- **Video completion rates** - Engagement with your rowing footage
- **Contact form submissions** - Direct interest from coaches
- **Geographic spread** - Reach across different regions

## ðŸ”§ Current Status

âœ… **Implemented:** Google Analytics 4 with comprehensive tracking
âœ… **Ready to deploy:** Just need your GA Measurement ID
âœ… **Fallback ready:** Plausible Analytics option available
âœ… **Documentation:** Complete setup guide included

## Next Steps

1. **Follow the `ANALYTICS-SETUP.md` guide** to get your Google Analytics ID
2. **Update the `.env` file** with your actual Measurement ID
3. **Deploy the website** with `npm run deploy`
4. **Check analytics in 24-48 hours** for your first data

The analytics will help you understand:

- Which coaches are most interested (time spent, pages viewed)
- What content resonates (video views, section engagement)
- Geographic reach of your recruitment profile
- Success rate (contact form submissions)

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of the setup process?
